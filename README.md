This equation clearly is consistent with Eq. (1.11), which contains the definition of the absolute temperature. The limiting process indicated in Eq. (1.11) rigorously eliminates the virial coefficients to provide a precise definition; Eq. (1.56) covers a useful range of densities for practical calculations and is called the ideal gas law.

## Partial pressures

A useful quantity for dealing with the individual components in a gas mixture is partial pressure. The partial pressure of a component in a mixture, for example, component $A$ , is defined by the equation

$$
p_{A} \equiv P y_{A} \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad( 1. 5 7 )

## Ideal gas law

Real gases under high pressure require the use of all three virials for accuracy in calculating z from $\rho_{M}$ and $T$ As the density is reduced by lowering the pressure, the numerical values of the virial terms fade out, although the values of the coefficients remain unchanged. As the effect of $D$ becomes negligible, the series is truncated by dropping its term, then the term in $C,$ and so on, until at low pressures (about l or $~ 2$ atm for ordinary gases), all three virials can be neglected. The result is the simple gas law

$$
z={\frac{p V} {n R T}}={\frac{p} {\rho_{M} R T}}=1 \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad( 1. 5 6 )
